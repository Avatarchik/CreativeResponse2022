When the app is opened, users are received on the title page where they can either
start their experience or adjust the app to their preference in the settings menu.
Carefully selected classical music and sound effects accompanies the app pages. The visuals 
are primarily handmade digital art for the app in conjunction with historical photography. 
The text narrates the stories of nine Pacific students in the third person as the user 
experiences a slice of their lives on the University of Pacificâ€™s Stockton Campus. 
The participant then learns of how drastic Executive Order 9066 was for Japanese American 
communities, and follows the students as they are forced to leave their homes for assembly 
centers. Learning of the Stockton Fairgrounds and the Rohwer Concentration Center, the events 
that shaped the incarcerated Japanese American community are presented to the viewer. The section 
regarding redress covers the historic consequence of events and how Pacific students moved 
beyond this tragedy. A remembrance of 55 University of the Pacific and Stockton Junior College 
students plays. A montage of lanterns with motifs of each of the nine students are presented to 
the viewer. Before the app concludes events of the past are linked to the present, asking 
how students now can change their present actions and attitudes for a better future. A link 
to a Google Form is available recording the answers anonymously for the aforementioned questions. 

In order to navigate the app, users are prompted to click buttons to continue to the next page.
